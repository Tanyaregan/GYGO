Cosplay is for everyone!
If you geek on something, there's a way to dress the part.

Get Your Geek On (Game of Thrones edition) is designed to let you poke through the characters of a particular fandom,
and check out options that may be available for putting together an amazing outfit.
You'll be cruising the cons in no time!

In this app you can search characters by:
Name, House, Episode, Title, Gender, or Deceased (It is GoT, after all..)

Basic search page:

You can also just browse through names, houses or episodes.

Once you get to a character you like, the main results page will show you all of the info on that character,
plus related costume items for sale on Etsy and eBay.
